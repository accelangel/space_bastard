If you’re reading this, then this was a conversation I had with an LLM about what I wanted the game to be. It will give you insight into the overall project and its goals. Some changes have been made since the making of this document. The map size has been cut in half, instead of 131072 x 131072, the map is now 131072 x 73729 pixels. 
🚀 Space Bastard – Core Game Architecture & Roadmap (v2 - Fresh Start)
This is the definitive development document for the new, from-scratch version of Space Bastard, a physics-driven tactical space combat sim. You are currently building a combat prototype that emphasizes real scale, real physics, and true spatial awareness — not abstract "strategy game" zoom grids.
We’re building toward a full FTL-like loop down the road, but for now: just the hard, beautiful truth of space combat.

🌌 CORE CONCEPT
The map is 131,072 x 131,072 pixels, where each pixel = 0.25 meters. This gives us a real-world map size of:
* 32,768 meters (32.768 km) per edge from center

* 65.536 km x 65.536 km total field
This is not a “zoom illusion” — this is the actual world size in which ships, torpedoes, and bullets live.

All gameplay occurs in this space, rendered via one unified 2D layer, with on-screen UI only. The player zooms the view (via Camera2D.zoom) to navigate it, not the other way around.

🧱 ARCHITECTURE (NODE TREE + STRUCTURE)
We keep things clean and simple.
🔸 Scene: WorldRoot.tscn (Main Scene)
This is the root node of the entire game. It contains everything.

📐 SCALING & WORLD SETTINGS
WorldSettings.gd
This autoloaded singleton stores core values:
gdscript
CopyEdit
var meters_per_pixel: float = 0.25
var map_size_pixels: int = 131072
var map_size_meters := map_size_pixels * meters_per_pixel


This sets the stage for true physics over real scale.

🔭 CAMERA ZOOM
The player can zoom smoothly in and out with the mouse wheel.
   * Zoom range: From full map view (fit ~65km) to ultra close-up (~10cm resolution)

   * Implemented in GameCamera.gd:

      * zoom = Vector2.ONE * new_zoom (min/max enforced)

      * Can eventually zoom to mouse cursor, but initially just center-based

⚙️ SYSTEMS (Core Gameplay)
✅ Physics-Based Ships
         * PlayerShip and EnemyShip are fully physics-aware

         * Movement is driven by force/impulse, not instant motion

         * Ships will never just "go to target" — you fire RCS or burn fuel to move

✅ Torpedoes (Phase 1)
            * Accelerate in straight lines with fixed thrust

            * Have rotational inertia (can’t instantly rotate)

            * Use own sensor data to predict intercepts

            * Calculations run in _physics_process(), with delta time scaled to real seconds

✅ Radar / Lidar (Phase 2)
               * Torpedoes/ships don’t "magically know" target location

               * They scan using:

                  * Radar: Slow update, wide angle, long range

                  * Lidar: Fast update, narrow angle, short range

                     * They build a local model of enemy location with confidence values (color-coded icons)

                     * Old data fades over time

✅ Interception & Misses
                        * Torpedoes can miss. They may never reacquire a target.

                        * Every intercept is based on physics, not cheat-seeking

                        * Evasive maneuvers from ships matter

________________


🔫 POINT DEFENSE SYSTEM (Phase 3)
Ships will automatically fire high-velocity bullets (PDC) at incoming torpedoes.
                           * Bullets are very fast, unguided

                           * Modeled as hitscan or fast-moving Area2D

                           * Use raycasts or bullet velocity logic to simulate near-instant kill windows

                           * Eventually include ammo tracking & blind spots

________________


💥 RAILGUNS (Phase 4)
                              * Fires solid kinetic rounds at absurd speed (e.g., 10,000+ m/s)

                              * No homing, just unguided slugs

                              * Useful for close-range kills or precision long-range strikes

                              * Will require high lead accuracy from the player

🧪 FUTURE: What This Demo Will Teach Us
                                                      * How feasible it is to run high-object-count space combat on a large map in 2D

                                                      * Whether sensor-driven combat feels satisfying and unique

                                                      * If we can make realistic systems intuitive enough for players to enjoy

🎯 GOAL: A Launchable Demo
This prototype will not have:
                                                         * Story

                                                         * Win conditions

                                                         * Meta progression

But it will allow you to:
                                                            * Watch 10+ torpedoes race across a massive battlefield

                                                            * See if they land hits or miss entirely due to bad data

                                                            * Test the limits of Newtonian tactics on a real scale map
